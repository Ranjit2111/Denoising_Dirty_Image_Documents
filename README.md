The repository contains code and dataset that was used for denoising dirty image documents. 
The data was actually taken from a competition conducted on Kaggle linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/denoising-dirty-documents/data).
I worked on the same data to build my own convolutional autoencoder model to submit for college's project work. 
The ipynb file contains the code for model architecture, k-fold validation as well code to visualize the performance across different folds to verify the model's robustness to generalise to unseen data. 
Thanks for reading.
